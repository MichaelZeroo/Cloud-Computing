            <h2>Limits of the Flying Machine.</h2>

            <p>
                In the opinion of competent experts it is idle to look for a commercial
                future for the flying machine. There is, and always will be, a limit to
                its carrying capacity which will prohibit its employment for passenger
                or freight purposes in a wholesale or general way. There are some, of
                course, who will argue that because a machine will carry two people
                another may be constructed that will carry a dozen, but those who make
                this contention do not understand the theory of weight sustentation in
                the air; or that the greater the load the greater must be the lifting
                power (motors and plane surface), and that there is a limit to these--as
                will be explained later on--beyond which the aviator cannot go.

                Some Practical Uses.
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the same time there are fields in which the flying machine may be
                used to great advantage. These are:
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sports--Flying machine races or flights will always be popular by reason
                        of the element of danger. It is a strange, but nevertheless a true
                        proposition, that it is this element which adds zest to all sporting
                        events.
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        Scientific--For exploration of otherwise inaccessible regions such as
                        deserts, mountain tops, etc.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Reconnoitering--In time of war flying machines may be used to advantage
                        to spy out an enemy's encampment, ascertain its defenses, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
