        <h2>Zeppelins</h2>

        <p>
            The U. S. Government has concluded arrangements (June, 1922) with the
            Allied Powers whereby the U. S. Navy will receive a modern Zeppelin as a
            part of America’s share of the aerial reparations.
        </p>

        <p>
            This new Zeppelin will embody the very latest improvements in airship
            design and will be delivered by being flown from Berlin across the
            Atlantic to the Navy’s Airship Harbor at Lakehurst, New Jersey. It will
            be built by Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin (Zeppelin Airship Building Co.,
            Ltd.), at their Friedrichshafen Works and will be a 70,000 cubic meter
            (2,400,000 cu. ft.) gas capacity commercial type, as it is intended that
            it will be flown in the United States to demonstrate the safety and
            practicability of long distance airship-transport. It will be delivered
            by a Zeppelin crew. The arrival in the United States of this strictly
            modern Zeppelin will no doubt create a wonderful interest as the
            American people have never seen a real Zeppelin and it will give a great
            impetus to airship activities throughout the world.
