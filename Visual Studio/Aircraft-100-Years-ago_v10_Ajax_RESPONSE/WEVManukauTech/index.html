        <p>
            "The present generation is lucky in that, despite this instinctive
            longing since the beginning of human history for the means of flight,
            it is the first to see dreams and theories translated into fact by the
            startling development of practical aviation, within the past fifteen
            years. The aëronautical wonders of the next fifteen years are likely to
            be yet more startling."
        </p>

        <p> Arthur Whitten Brown, 1920</p>
